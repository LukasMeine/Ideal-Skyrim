V1.2

This is the non mask version of Lightnings Head. 
I was confused as to which way to do this so people can use NMM and Manual install
without confusion and came to the conclusion of adding the hairs in for you and 
naming them. 
(normally it was just a rar file which was the base and from there you
choose from the hair types rar files and extract and replace manually. This
way would work for manual installers but would make it difficult for NMM)

There are 5 rar files and some pictures to help you decide which version you
want.
The "saves" rar file is a save of the already made lightning. This is optional.
To use the save, extract it and move the .ess file to my documents/my games/skyrim/saves
and proceed to load the mod into Nexus Mod Manager or install manually. From then
you just start up the game and load up the "Lightning" save file :D

There are 4 versions of hair you can choose and the pictures are named after
the rar files to make it easier for you.

If you wish to install the mod manually, then just extract the hair type folder
you want and copy the data folder into your skyrim install directory.
NMM way is just to add the rar file and simply activate.
If you wish to change hair, then simply overwright the mod with your choice
(this is the manual version)
Or just simply deactivate and activate the one you wish
(NMM version)

I hope you can understand this! 
If not, I appologise as I am very tired haha ^_^
